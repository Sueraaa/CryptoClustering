# CryptoClustering
## Module 19 Challenge
In this challenge, you’ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.


## What’s the best value for k?

Based on the line chart, it appears that there are four clusters, as indicated by the sharpest bend in both the elbow curve.

## Based on visually analysing the cluster analysis results, what’s the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data by using K-means?

* Using fewer dimensions can reduced the complexity of the clustering process. 

* In the K-Means plot, clusters rarely overlap, whereas in the PCA plot, they frequently overlap. 

* Using fewer dimensions may also lead to loss of information.
